			<img src="Ben%20Johnson.jpg" alt="Ben Johnson Photo" height="139" width="250" />
			<p>Ben Johnson, born November 9, 1988, grew up in Lancaster, PA. He graduated from Hempfield High School in June 2007. At Hempfield he earned four varsity letters in tennis, played oboe in the concert band, and was co-editor-in-chief of the newspaper. He completed his undergraduate studies at Elizabethtown College in three years, graduating with a BS in mathematics with a second major in economics and a minor in Spanish. After passing actuarial exam FM (financial mathematics), Ben interned with the actuarial department of Arch Insurance in New York, NY during the summer of 2009.</p>
	<p>Upon graduation from Elizabethtown College, Ben began graduate school at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. He graduated with an MS in economics in December 2011. At UNC, he studied applied microeconomics and wrote a Master's paper titled <a href="http://benrobjoh.com/education/unc/Student%20Debt.pdf" onClick = "_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'Downloads', 'PDF', 'Student Debt: Who Borrows?']);">"Student Debt: Who Borrows?"</a>. He took courses in health economics, labor economics, empirical industrial organization, and econometrics.</p>
			<p>He released his first iPhone app, <a href="http://click.linksynergy.com/fs-bin/stat?id=sXVjBlpBuDI&offerid=146261&type=3&subid=0&tmpid=1826&RD_PARM1=http%253A%252F%252Fitunes.apple.com%252Fus%252Fapp%252Fbaseliner%252Fid554343726%253Fmt%253D8%2526uo%253D4%2526partnerId%253D30" target="itunes_store">Baseliner</a>, in August 2012. Baseliner keeps a record of the user's tennis matches. Users can add an opponent, score, date, and location to each match. Users can keep track of their wins and losses against each particular opponent. The app interfaces with Twitter to allow users to tweet the results of their matches and with Dropbox to allow users to export their information from Baseliner into Dropbox.</p>

						This paper uses a selection model to investigate what characteristics of students affect the probability and amount of student debt. While most previous work in the area of student debt examines the effects of student debt on schooling and employment decisions, this paper looks at the demographic, financial, and psychological factors that determine whether a student uses debt to finance his education. The main findings are that increased savings does not decrease the probability or amount of student debt accrued and that increased family income decreases the probability of student debt, but increases the average amount of debt, given that the student has some debt.

						When an individual becomes disabled, he faces a decision whether to continue working or to apply for disability benefits through Social Security Disability Insurance (SSDI). The indi- vidual must consider tradeoffs between continuing to work and applying for SSDI benefits. If the individual continues to work, he might make his disability worse. If he applies for dis- ability benefits, he must quit his job, forgoing his wages and losing his accumulated tenure with his employer. He also faces the uncertainty of whether his SSDI application will be approved. This paper models the disabled individual's decision-making process.

						This paper uses a selection model and a Tobit model to investigate the effects of religion on the probability and amount of charitable donations. The main findings from the selection model are that being Catholic or Protestant make a family more likely to donate to charity than people who do not identify with a religion. Protestants, on average, donate more money to charity than people who do not identify with a religion. The Tobit model finds that Catholics, Jews, Protestants, and non-Christians give significantly more money to charity than non-religious people.

						Colleges in the United States price discriminate based on student characteristics such as ability and income. This paper develops a model of college pricing in which colleges maximize their prestige. Several policy experiments are considered in which the college loses the ability to price discriminate at all or to price discriminate with respect to income.

					<p id="tuitionabstract" class="abstract">This paper investigates the economics of college tuition and financial aid. In the United States, colleges set their tuition rates before each academic year. Most students, however, do not pay the full tuition rate, with 62.2% of full-time undergraduates receiving some type of financial aid in 2007-2008. Colleges price discriminate, attempting to figure out how much each particular student would be willing to pay, and charging that rate. College financial aid offices meet the difference between the full tuition rate and what the student is deemed able to pay with institutional loans, government-subsidized loans, and grants. This type of aid is based on financial need. The goal of providing financial aid to students is to ensure that lower-income students have an opportunity to attend college. In addition to this goal, colleges use price discrimination as a way to increase their revenue. This paper will explore the economic theory behind price discrimination and how the behavior of the college fits that of a profit-maximizing firm.  This paper will analyze what a student could expect to pay as a percentage of total income at different income levels and the effects of the financial aid system on the labor market and retirement saving.</p>

			<ul>
				<li><a href="images/saas1.pdf">CS169.1x, Engineering Long-Lasting Software</a>
					<ul>
						<li>CS169.1x teaches the fundamentals for engineering long-lasting software using highly-productive Agile techniques to develop Software as a Service (SaaS) using Ruby on Rails. Students will understand the new challenges and opportunities of SaaS versus shrink-wrapped software. They will understand and apply fundamental programming techniques to the design, development, testing, and public cloud deployment of a simple SaaS application. Students will use best-of-breed tools that support modern development techniques including behavior-driven design, user stories, test-driven development, velocity, and pair programming. Students will learn how modern programming language features like metaprogramming and reflection can improve productivity and code maintainability.</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
				<li><a href="images/saas2.pdf">CS169.2x, Engineering Long-Lasting Software</a>
					<ul>
						<li>CS 169.2x is the second half of University of California, Berkeley's semester long course on Software as a Service. In the first half of the course, CS 169.1x, students use Agile development methods to deploy a simple SaaS app in the cloud. In the second half, CS 169.2x, students create more sophisticated apps by adding relationships between models in apps and by enhancing their apps with JavaScript. They also learn about what happens after the apps are deployed to real users, including how to monitor performance, identify and fix common performance problems, and avoid compromising customer data. Finally, students learn how to apply Agile techniques to enhance and refactor legacy code, a critical skill for professional programmers. Other topics covered in CS 169.2x include how to form, organize and manage small programming teams, an introduction to design patterns: what they are and how to recognize opportunities to apply them, and using Rails for more advanced features like third-party authentication and elegantly expressing design patterns that arise frequently in SaaS.</li>
