<p id="tuitionabstract" class="abstract">This paper investigates the economics of college tuition and financial aid. In the United States, colleges set their tuition rates before each academic year. Most students, however, do not pay the full tuition rate, with 62.2% of full-time undergraduates receiving some type of financial aid in 2007-2008. Colleges price discriminate, attempting to figure out how much each particular student would be willing to pay, and charging that rate. College financial aid offices meet the difference between the full tuition rate and what the student is deemed able to pay with institutional loans, government-subsidized loans, and grants. This type of aid is based on financial need. The goal of providing financial aid to students is to ensure that lower-income students have an opportunity to attend college. In addition to this goal, colleges use price discrimination as a way to increase their revenue. This paper will explore the economic theory behind price discrimination and how the behavior of the college fits that of a profit-maximizing firm.  This paper will analyze what a student could expect to pay as a percentage of total income at different income levels and the effects of the financial aid system on the labor market and retirement saving.</p>
